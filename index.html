<b>What I Love</b> <br> 
<img src="me.jpg" alt="My face" height="42" width="42">
<br>
<p>From a young age, I enjoyed learning languages, writing and working with my computer.  I never imagined that my interests would become my college majors in the future.  My senior year of high school was a huge turning point in my life.  I taught myself how to code, I was the only non-Asian person to take level one Mandarin Chinese and I started a short story blog that when I closed it for college had over 1200 followers.  None of the things I loved to do are easy for me to accomplish.  Coding is difficult, Chinese is difficult, Writing is difficult, but these challenges inspire me to keep moving.  Now, I am hoping to start learning data science, I am working on improving my language skills in Mandarin, Korean and Spanish and I am the co-editor for the Amherst College chapter of online magazine, Her Campus.  I'm happy doing what I love and I hope I can do these things for the rest of my life. </p>

	<h1> Hi There! </h1> <br>
	<b> Welcome to my github webpage!</b>  <br>
	
	<center> This webpage was created to practice my CSS/HTML skills, so a lot of the information will be outdated
		Here are a few things that will never change: </center> <br>

	<li> I started coding when I wanted to edit my Yahoo webpage in 3rd grade and Tumblr in high school.  
	<li>  Because of this, web design has always been the most therapeutic coding for me and I probably won't pursue it professionally   </li>
	<li> The transition to backend was not easy. I learned while pursuing my college degree that natural talent is nice, but <i> practice </i> is the key to success  </li>
	<li> Outside of coding languages: I also study Mandarin Chinese and Korean.  I also speak some Spanish ^^ </li>
	<li> Other things that make me happy: story-telling (written and verbal), listening to music, dancing, trying new foods and making people smile </li>

	<p>My name is Carina Corbin and I am currently pursuing in Master's of Engineering in Computer Science at Cornell Tech </p>
	<br>
	<p> Prior to Cornell, I worked in client-facing software development roles full-time at Avanade and Palantir.  During my undergraduate degree at Amherst, I held software engineering internships in virtual reality research, SaaS, and investmant banking. </p>
        <br>
	<p> My passion is building user-centric software.  Whether using Java or Pyspark, speaking English or Mandarin, I do my best to break down difficult problems and create technical solutoins. </p<

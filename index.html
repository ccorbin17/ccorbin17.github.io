	<h1> Hi There! </h1> <br>
	<b> Welcome to my github webpage!</b>  <br>
	
	<center> This webpage was created to practice my CSS/HTML skills, so a lot of the information will be outdated
		Here are a few things that will never change: </center> <br>

	
<div class="clearfix aboutme">
<img src="me.jpg" width=300>
	<div>
	<li> I started coding when I wanted to edit my Yahoo webpage in 3rd grade and Tumblr in high school.  
	<li>  Because of this, web design has always been the most therapeutic coding for me and I probably won't pursue it professionally   </li>
	<li> The transition to backend was not easy. I learned while pursuing my college degree that natural talent is nice, but <i> practice </i> is the key to success  </li>
	<li> Outside of coding languages: I also study Mandarin Chinese and Korean.  I also speak some Spanish ^^ </li>
	<li> Other things that make me happy: story-telling (written and verbal), listening to music, dancing, trying new foods and making people smile </li>

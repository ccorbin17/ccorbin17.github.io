<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
    <li> Over the years, I have grown comfortable with the following programming languages: Java, Python, Pyspark, SQL, JavaScript, C#</li>
    <li> I love learning languages. In addition to my native tongue English, I also speak Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and some Spanish! </li>
    <li> I love going to the library, so you will often find me with a book in my bag.  I also love writing short stories (maybe one day it will be a novel!)  </li>
    <li> Music is everything to me! I love to dance and previously played piano and guitar. I have these instruments at home, and don't practice as much as I should. </li>
    <li> A recent pastime of mine has been cooking/baking seemingly difficult recipes. Some of my favorites have been mooncakes and Trinidian style roti! </li>
